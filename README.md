# ResNet Implementation

Implementing ResNet for training on CIFAR10 with GPU.

## Todo
- GPU access
- argparse
- learning rate decay (first high, then low)
- += residual
- progress bar as wright
- avgpool2d (GAP)
- 7x7 conv decomposed into three 3x3 convs
- TensorBoard support
- Custom Logger
- (maxpool in beginning)
